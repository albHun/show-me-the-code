 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.~
 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!~
 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.~
 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.~
 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.~
 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.~
 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.~
 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.~
 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.~
 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.~
 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.~
 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.~
 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.~
 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.~
 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.~
 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.~
 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.~
 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.~
 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.~
 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.~
 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.~
 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.~
 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.~
 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.~
 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.~
 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.~
 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.~
 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.~
 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.~
 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.~
 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.~
 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.~
 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.~
 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.~
 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.~
 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.~
 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.~
 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.~
 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.~
 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.~
 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.~
 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.~
 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.~
 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.~
 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.~
 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.~
 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.~
 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.~
 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.~
 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.~
 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.~
 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.~
 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.~
 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.~
 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.~
 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.~
 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.~
 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.~
 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.~
 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.~
 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.~
 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.~
 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.~
 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.~
 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.~
 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.~
 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.~
 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.~
 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.~
 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.~
 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.~
 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.~
 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight.~
 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.~
 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.~
 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.~
 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.~
 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?~
 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.~
 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!~
 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.~
 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.~
 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.~
 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.~
 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.~
 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.~
 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.~
 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.~
 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.~
 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.~
 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.~
 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.~
 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:~
 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.~
 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.~
 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.~
 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.~
 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.~
 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.~
 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.~
 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.~
 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.~
 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.~
 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;~
 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:~
 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:~
 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:~
 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.~
 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.~
 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.~
 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.~
 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.~
 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.~
 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.~
 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.~
 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.~
 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.~
 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.~
 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.~
 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.~
 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.~
 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.~
 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.~
 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.~
 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.~
 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.~
 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.~
 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.~
 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.~
 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.~
 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.~
 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.~
 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.~
 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:~
 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.~
 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.~
 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.~
 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.~
 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:~
 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.~
 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.~
 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.~
 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.~
 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?~
 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.~
 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.~
 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.~
 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.~
 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.~
 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.~
 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.~
 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.~
 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:~
 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;~
 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;~
 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,~
 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.~
 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.~
 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.~
 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.~
 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.~
 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.~
 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.~
 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.~
 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.~
 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.~
 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.~
 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.~
 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.~
 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.~
 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!~
 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;~
 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.~
 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.~
 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.~
 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.~
 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.~
 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.~
 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.~
 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.~
 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.~
 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.~
 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.~
 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.~
 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.~
 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;~
 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:~
 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.~
 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.~
 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.~
 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.~
 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;~
 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.~
 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.~
 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:~
 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.~
 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.~
 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.~
 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.~
 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.~
