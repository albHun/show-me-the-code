 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;~
 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;~
 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.~
 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.~
 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.~
 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.~
 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.~
 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.~
 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.~
 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.~
 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.~
 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:~
 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:~
 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not:~
 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.~
 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:~
 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.~
 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel.~
 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about.~
 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.~
 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat:~
 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:~
 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.~
 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:~
 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.~
 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.~
 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp.~
 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.~
 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.~
 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:~
 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD.~
 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever.~
 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments:~
 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.~
 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying,~
 What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,~
 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:~
 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD.~
 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.~
 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.~
 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,~
 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.~
 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people.~
 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.~
 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.~
 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.~
 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.~
 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.~
 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.~
 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.~
 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God.~
 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.~
 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.~
 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.~
 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness.~
 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.~
 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness.~
 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.~
 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman.~
 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.~
 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.~
 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.~
 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness.~
 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.~
 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.~
 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.~
 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.~
 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.~
 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.~
 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion.~
 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:~
 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.~
 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:~
 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)~
 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.~
 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.~
 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.~
 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.~
 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.~
 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.~
 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.~
 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.~
 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.~
 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.~
 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.~
 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.~
 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.~
 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.~
 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.~
 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.~
 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I am the LORD.~
 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.~
 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.~
 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.~
 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.~
 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering.~
 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.~
 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.~
 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal.~
 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.~
 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.~
 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.~
 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.~
 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.~
 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.~
 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.~
 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.~
 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.~
 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.~
 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.~
 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.~
 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.~
 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.~
 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:~
 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.~
 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.~
 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.~
 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.~
 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.~
 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.~
 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.~
 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.~
 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.~
 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.~
 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.~
 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.~
 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.~
 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.~
 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.~
 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.~
 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.~
 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.~
 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.~
 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people.~
 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.~
 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.~
 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.~
 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:~
 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother.~
 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled.~
 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.~
 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.~
 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.~
 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God.~
 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy.~
 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.~
 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;~
 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother;~
 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.~
 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.~
 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.~
 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.~
 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous,~
 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,~
 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;~
 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.~
 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.~
 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.~
 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.~
 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.~
 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;~
 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;~
 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.~
 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.~
 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.~
 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.~
 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.~
 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.~
 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.~
 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no stranger eat thereof.~
 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing.~
 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;~
 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;~
 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.~
 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.~
 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.~
 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.~
 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.~
 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land.~
 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.~
 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.~
 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will.~
 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.~
