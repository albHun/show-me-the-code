 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.~
 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.~
 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.~
 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.~
 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.~
 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.~
 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.~
 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;~
 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.~
 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.~
 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.~
 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.~
 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.~
 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.~
 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.~
 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.~
 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;~
 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.~
 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.~
 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.~
 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.~
 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.~
 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.~
 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.~
 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.~
 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.~
 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.~
 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.~
 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.~
 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.~
 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.~
 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.~
 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.~
 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.~
 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.~
 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.~
 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.~
 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.~
 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.~
 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.~
 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.~
 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.~
 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.~
 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.~
 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.~
 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.~
 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.~
 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.~
 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.~
 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:~
 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.~
 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.~
 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.~
 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?~
 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;~
 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:~
 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)~
 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.~
 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.~
 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.~
 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.~
 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.~
 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.~
 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.~
 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;~
 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.~
 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.~
 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.~
 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.~
 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.~
 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.~
 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.~
 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.~
 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.~
 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.~
 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.~
 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.~
 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.~
 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.~
 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.~
 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.~
 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?~
 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:~
 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.~
 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?~
 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind thee.~
 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.~
 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.~
 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.~
 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.~
 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.~
 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.~
 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.~
 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.~
 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.~
 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.~
 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.~
 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.~
 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.~
 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.~
 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.~
 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.~
 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.~
 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.~
 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.~
 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.~
 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.~
 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.~
 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.~
 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.~
 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.~
 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually.~
 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.~
 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.~
 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.~
 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.~
 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:~
 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.~
 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.~
 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.~
 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.~
 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.~
 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.~
 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.~
 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.~
 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.~
 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.~
 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.~
 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.~
 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.~
 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.~
 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.~
 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.~
 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.~
 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;~
 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.~
 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.~
 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.~
 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.~
 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.~
 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.~
 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.~
 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.~
 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.~
 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:~
 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.~
 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.~
 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.~
 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.~
 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.~
 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.~
 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.~
 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.~
 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.~
 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.~
 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.~
 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.~
 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High.~
 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.~
 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.~
 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.~
 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.~
 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God.~
 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?~
 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.~
 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.~
 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.~
 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.~
 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?~
 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.~
 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.~
 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.~
 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.~
 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.~
 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.~
 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.~
 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.~
 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.~
 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.~
 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.~
 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?~
 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.~
 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.~
 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;~
 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.~
 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.~
 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.~
 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.~
 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.~
 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.~
 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.~
 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.~
 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.~
 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.~
 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.~
 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.~
 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.~
 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?~
 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.~
 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.~
