 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.~
 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.~
 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.~
 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:~
 And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;~
 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.~
 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.~
 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;~
 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;~
 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.~
 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.~
 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.~
 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.~
 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.~
 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.~
 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.~
 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.~
 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.~
 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.~
 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;~
 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.~
 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.~
 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.~
 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.~
 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.~
 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.~
 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.~
 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.~
 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.~
 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.~
 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.~
 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.~
 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.~
 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.~
 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?~
 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.~
 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.~
 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.~
 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.~
 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.~
 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.~
 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.~
 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.~
 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.~
 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.~
 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.~
 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.~
 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.~
 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.~
 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.~
 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me.~
 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.~
 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.~
 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.~
 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,~
 The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.~
 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.~
 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.~
 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.~
 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:~
 But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.~
 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.~
 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:~
 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.~
 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.~
 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.~
 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.~
 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.~
 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!~
 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.~
 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.~
 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.~
 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.~
 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:~
 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.~
 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.~
 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.~
 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,~
 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,~
 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,~
 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,~
 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,~
 Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,~
 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,~
 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,~
 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,~
 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,~
 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,~
 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,~
 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,~
 Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,~
 Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,~
 Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.~
 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.~
 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.~
 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?~
 Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.~
 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:~
 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,~
 And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.~
 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.~
 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.~
 And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.~
 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,~
 Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.~
 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.~
 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.~
 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.~
 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.~
 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.~
 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.~
 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.~
 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.~
 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?  And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.~
 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.~
 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.~
 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.~
 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.~
 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.~
 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.~
 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.~
 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.~
 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.~
 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.~
 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.~
 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.~
 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:~
 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.~
 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?~
 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.~
 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?~
 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.~
 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.~
 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?~
 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.~
 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:~
 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.~
 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.~
 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.~
 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.~
 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.~
 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?~
 For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.~
 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.~
 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?~
 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.~
 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,~
 Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.~
 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.~
 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.~
 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:~
 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.~
 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.~
 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.~
 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.~
 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.~
 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.~
 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.~
 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?~
 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.~
 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.~
 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:~
 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.~
 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.~
 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.~
 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.~
 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.~
 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.~
 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword.~
 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.~
 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.~
 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,~
 I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;~
 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:~
 That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.~
 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.~
 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.~
 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.~
 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.~
 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.~
 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.~
 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.~
 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.~
 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.~
 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.~
 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.~
 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.~
 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.~
 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.~
 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand.~
 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.~
 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.~
 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.~
 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.~
 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.~
 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.~
 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.~
 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.~
 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.~
 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.~
