 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.~
 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!~
 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?~
 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.~
 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?~
 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:~
 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?~
 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.~
 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.~
 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.~
 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.~
 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.~
 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.~
 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.~
 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.~
 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.~
 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.~
 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.~
 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.~
 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.~
 Then Job answered and said,~
 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.~
 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!~
 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.~
 I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.~
 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.~
 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.~
 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:~
 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:~
 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.~
 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.~
 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.~
 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.~
 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.~
 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.~
 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:~
 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.~
 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?~
 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.~
 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.~
 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.~
 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.~
 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.~
 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.~
 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.~
 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.~
 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;~
 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.~
 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.~
 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.~
 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.~
 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.~
 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.~
 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.~
 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.~
 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.~
 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.~
 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.~
 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.~
 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.~
 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.~
 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?~
 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,~
 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places.~
 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise?~
 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?~
 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.~
 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?~
 But Job answered and said,~
 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?~
 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?~
 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?~
 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.~
 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.~
 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.~
 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.~
 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.~
 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.~
 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.~
 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.~
 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.~
 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?~
 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,~
 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;~
 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;~
 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.~
 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.~
 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.~
 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.~
 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?~
 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?~
 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?~
 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.~
 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?~
 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.~
 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.~
 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.~
 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;~
 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.~
 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.~
 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.~
 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.~
 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.~
 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.~
 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.~
 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.~
 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.~
 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.~
 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.~
 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.~
 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.~
 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:~
 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.~
 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.~
 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.~
 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.~
 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?~
 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.~
 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.~
 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.~
 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.~
 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.~
 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.~
 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.~
 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?~
 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.~
 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.~
 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.~
 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;~
 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.~
 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:~
 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.~
 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.~
 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,~
 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;~
 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;~
 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;~
 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;~
 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;~
 When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!~
 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.~
 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.~
 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.~
 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:~
 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.~
 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.~
 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.~
 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.~
 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.~
 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.~
 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.~
 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.~
 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.~
 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.~
 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.~
 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.~
 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.~
 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.~
 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.~
 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?~
 For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.~
 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.~
 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)~
 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.~
 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.~
 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.~
 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.~
 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.~
 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.~
 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.~
 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.~
 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.~
 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.~
 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.~
 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.~
 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.~
 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.~
 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.~
 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.~
 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.~
 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.~
 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.~
 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?~
 When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.~
 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.~
 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.~
 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.~
 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.~
 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.~
 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?~
 For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?~
 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?~
 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?~
 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;~
 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity.~
 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;~
 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.~
 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;~
 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.~
 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.~
