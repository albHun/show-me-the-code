 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.~
 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;~
 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?~
 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?~
 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;~
 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;~
 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)~
 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;~
 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;~
 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:~
 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.~
 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.~
 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;~
 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;~
 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;~
 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:~
 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.~
 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:~
 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.~
 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh!  we cannot be satisfied.~
 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.~
 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:~
 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?~
 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.~
 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.~
 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.~
 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;~
 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:~
 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.~
 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.~
 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.~
 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.~
 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.~
 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.~
 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.~
 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.~
 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.~
 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.~
 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.~
 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.~
 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:~
 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.~
 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.~
 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.~
 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)~
 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.~
 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.~
 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.~
 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.~
 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.~
 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.~
 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.~
 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.~
 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.~
 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.~
 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.~
 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.~
 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.~
 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,~
 I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.~
 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,~
 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.~
 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.~
 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.~
 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.~
 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;~
 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,~
 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.~
 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.~
 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:~
 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.~
 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.~
 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.~
 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:~
 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.~
 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:~
 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.~
 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;~
 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.~
 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,~
 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.~
 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.~
 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.~
 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.~
 Furthermore Elihu answered and said,~
 Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.~
 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.~
 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.~
 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.~
 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.~
 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?~
 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.~
 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.~
 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.~
 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.~
 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.~
 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?~
 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;~
 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.~
 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.~
 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?~
 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?~
 How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.~
 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.~
 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.~
 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.~
 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.~
 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.~
 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.~
 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;~
 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:~
 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.~
 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:~
 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.~
 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:~
 That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.~
 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.~
 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.~
 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.~
 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.~
 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.~
 Elihu spake moreover, and said,~
 Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?~
 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?~
 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.~
 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.~
 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?~
 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?~
 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.~
 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.~
 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;~
 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?~
 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.~
 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.~
 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.~
 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:~
 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.~
 Elihu also proceeded, and said,~
 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.~
 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.~
 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.~
 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.~
 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.~
 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.~
 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;~
 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.~
 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.~
 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.~
 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.~
 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.~
 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.~
 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.~
 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.~
 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.~
 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.~
 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.~
 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.~
 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.~
 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?~
 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?~
 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.~
 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.~
 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.~
 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:~
 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.~
 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?~
 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.~
 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.~
 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.~
 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.~
 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.~
 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.~
 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.~
 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.~
 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.~
 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.~
 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.~
 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.~
 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.~
 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.~
 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:~
 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.~
 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.~
 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.~
 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?~
 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?~
 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?~
 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?~
 Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.~
 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.~
 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.~
 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.~
 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.~
 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.~
 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,~
 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?~
 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.~
 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.~
 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?~
 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;~
