 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.~
 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.~
 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.~
 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.~
 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.~
 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?~
 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.~
 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.~
 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.~
 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.~
 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.~
 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,~
 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.~
 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.~
 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.~
 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.~
 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.~
 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.~
 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.~
 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.~
 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.~
 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.~
 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.~
 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.~
 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.~
 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.~
 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.~
 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.~
 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.~
 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.~
 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.~
 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.~
 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.~
 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.~
 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.~
 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.~
 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.~
 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.~
 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.~
 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.~
 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.~
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.~
 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.~
 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.~
 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?~
 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.~
 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.~
 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.~
 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.~
 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.~
 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.~
 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.~
 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.~
 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.~
 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.~
 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.~
 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.~
 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.~
 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.~
 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.~
 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.~
 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.~
 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.~
 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.~
 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.~
 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.~
 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.~
 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.~
 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.~
 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.~
 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.~
 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.~
 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.~
 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.~
 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.~
 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.~
 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.~
 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.~
 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.~
 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:~
 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.~
 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.~
 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:~
 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.~
 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.~
 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.~
 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?~
 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.~
 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.~
 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.~
 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.~
 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.~
 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.~
 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.~
 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.~
 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.~
 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.~
 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.~
 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.~
 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.~
 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.~
 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.~
 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.~
 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.~
 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.~
 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.~
 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.~
 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.~
 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.~
 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength.~
 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.~
 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.~
 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.~
 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.~
 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.~
 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.~
 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.~
 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.~
 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever.~
 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.~
 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.~
 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.~
 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.~
 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.~
 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.~
 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.~
 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.~
 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.~
 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?~
 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.~
 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;~
 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.~
 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.~
 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.~
 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.~
 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.~
 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.~
 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.~
 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;~
 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.~
 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.~
 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.~
 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.~
 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.~
 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.~
 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.~
 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.~
 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.~
 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.~
 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.~
 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!~
 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.~
 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.~
 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.~
 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.~
 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.~
 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.~
 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.~
 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.~
 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.~
 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.~
 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.~
 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.~
 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.~
 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.~
 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.~
 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.~
 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.~
 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.~
 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.~
 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.~
 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.~
 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.~
 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.~
 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.~
 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.~
 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.~
 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.~
 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.~
 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.~
 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.~
 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.~
 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.~
 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.~
 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;~
 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.~
 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.~
 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.~
 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.~
 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.~
 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.~
 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.~
 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.~
 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.~
 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.~
 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.~
 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.~
 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.~
 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.~
 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.~
