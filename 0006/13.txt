 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.~
 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.~
 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together.~
 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.~
 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.~
 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.~
 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.~
 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.~

 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.~
 And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.~
 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold.~
 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.~
 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.~
 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.~
 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.~
 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.~
 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.~
 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.~
 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.~
 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.~
 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;~
 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.~

 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.~
 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.~
 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.~
 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,~
 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,~
 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,~
 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,~
 The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,~
 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,~

 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.~
 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.~
 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.~
 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.~
 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.~
 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.~
 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.~
 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.~
 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.~
 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.~
 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.~
 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.~
 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.~
 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.~
 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:~
 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.~
 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.~
 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.~
 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.~
 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.~
 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:~
 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.~
 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.~
 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.~
 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.~
 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.~
 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:~
 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.~
 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.~
 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.~
 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.~
 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:~
 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.~
 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.~
 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.~
 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.~
 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:~
 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.~
 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.~
 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,~
 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.~
 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.~
 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.~
 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.~
 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.~
 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:~
 And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:~
 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.~
 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.~
 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar.~
 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar:~
 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.~
 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.~
 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:~
 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:~
 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.~
 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:~
 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:~
 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.~
 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.~
 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.~
 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering.~
 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.~
 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.~
 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.~
 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.~
 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.~
 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.~
 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.~
 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.~
 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering.~
 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.~
 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.~
 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.~
 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,~
 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.~
 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.~
 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.~
 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD.~
 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.~
 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,~
 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.~
 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD.~
 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD.~
 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.~
 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,~
 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.~
 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the LORD's.~
 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:~
 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.~
 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.~
