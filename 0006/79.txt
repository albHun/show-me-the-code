 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.~
 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.~
 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.~
 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.~
 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.~
 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.~
 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.~
 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.~
 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.~
 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.~
 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.~
 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.~
 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.~
 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.~
 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.~
 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.~
 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised.~
 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.~
 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,~
 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!~
 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;~
 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.~
 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.~
 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;~
 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.~
 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.~
 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.~
 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?~
 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?~
 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;~
 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.~
 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.~
 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?~
 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.~
 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.~
 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:~
 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:~
 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.~
 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.~
 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.~
 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.~
 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.~
 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.~
 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.~
 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.~
 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.~
 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.~
 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.~
 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.~
 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.~
 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.~
 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.~
 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.~
 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.~
 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.~
 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.~
 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.~
 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.~
 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:~
 I said in my haste, All men are liars.~
 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?~
 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.~
 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.~
 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.~
 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.~
 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.~
 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.~
 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.~
 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.~
 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.~
 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.~
 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.~
 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.~
 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever.~
 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.~
 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?~
 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.~
 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.~
 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.~
 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.~
 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.~
 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.~
 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.~
 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.~
 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.~
 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.~
 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.~
 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.~
 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:~
 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.~
 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.~
 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.~
 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.~
 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.~
 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.~
 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.~
 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.~
 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.~
 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.~
 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.~
 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.~
 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.~
 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.~
 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!~
 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.~
 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.~
 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.~
 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.~
 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.~
 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.~
 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.~
 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.~
 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.~
 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.~
 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.~
 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.~
 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.~
 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.~
 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.~
 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.~
 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.~
 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.~
 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.leth.~
 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.~
 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.~
 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.~
 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.~
 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.~
 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.~
 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.~
 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.~
 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.~
 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.~
 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.~
 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.~
 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.~
 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.~
 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.~
 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.~
 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.~
 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.~
 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.~
 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.~
 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.~
 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.~
 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.~
 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.~
 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.~
 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.~
 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.~
 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.~
 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.~
 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.~
 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.~
 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.~
 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.~
 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.~
 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.~
 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.~
 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.~
 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.~
 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.~
 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.~
 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.~
 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.~
 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.~
 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.~
 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.~
 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.~
 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.~
 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.~
 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.~
 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.~
 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.~
 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.~
 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.~
 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.~
 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.~
 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.~
 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.~
 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?~
 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.~
 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?~
 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.~
 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.~
 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.~
 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.~
 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.~
 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.~
 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.~
 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.~
 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.~
 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.~
 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.~
 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.~
 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.~
 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.~
 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.~
 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.~
 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.~
