 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.~
 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;~
 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;~
 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;~
 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.~
 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:~
 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.~
 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.~
 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:~
 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.~
 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.~
 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:~
 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:~
 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:~
 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:~
 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:~
 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.~
 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.~
 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.~
 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.~
 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:~
 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,~
 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?~
 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.~
 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;~
 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:~
 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;~
 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.~
 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:~
 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:~
 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.~
 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.~
 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.~
 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.~
 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;~
 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;~
 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;~
 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;~
 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.~
 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.~
 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.~
 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.~
 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.~
 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;~
 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:~
 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;~
 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;~
 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;~
 Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:~
 To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;~
 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.~
 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.~
 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.~
 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.~
 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.~
 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.~
 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:~
 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.~
 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:~
 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.~
 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.~
 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.~
 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.~
 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.~
 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:~
 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.~
 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:~
 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.~
 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.~
 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.~
 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.~
 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.~
 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.~
 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.~
 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.~
 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.~
 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:~
 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.~
 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.~
 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.~
 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.~
 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.~
 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.~
 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.~
 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.~
 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.~
 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.~
 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.~
 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.~
 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.~
 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.~
 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.~
 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.~
 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.~
 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.~
 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.~
 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.~
 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.~
 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.~
 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.~
 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.~
 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.~
 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.~
 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.~
 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.~
 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.~
 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.~
 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.~
 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.~
 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.~
 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.~
 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.~
 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.~
 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.~
 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.~
 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.~
 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.~
 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.~
 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:~
 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.~
 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:~
 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.~
 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.~
 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.~
 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.~
 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:~
 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:~
 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;~
 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,~
 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;~
 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!~
 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.~
 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.~
 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.~
 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.~
 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.~
 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.~
 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?~
 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.~
 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.~
 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.~
 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,~
 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.~
 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.~
 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.~
 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.~
 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:~
 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,~
 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.~
 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?~
 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:~
 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.~
 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.~
 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;~
 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.~
 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.~
 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:~
 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,~
 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,~
 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.~
 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:~
 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.~
 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.~
 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:~
 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.~
 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.~
 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.~
 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?~
 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?~
 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.~
 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;~
 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.~
 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.~
 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.~
 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.~
 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.~
 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.~
 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.~
 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.~
 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:~
 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.~
 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,~
 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,~
 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,~
 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:~
 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.~
 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:~
 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)~
 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,~
 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.~
 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.~
 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.~
 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.~
 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.~
 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:~
 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.~
 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.~
 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;~
 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.~
 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.~
