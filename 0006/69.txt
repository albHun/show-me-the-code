 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?~
 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?~
 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,~
 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,~
 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?~
 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;~
 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?~
 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.~
 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.~
 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?~
 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?~
 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.~
 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,~
 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?~
 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?~
 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,~
 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?~
 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?~
 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;~
 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;~
 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?~
 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?~
 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?~
 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.~
 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?~
 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?~
 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?~
 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?~
 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are?~
 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?~
 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,~
 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?~
 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,~
 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?~
 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.~
 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?~
 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?~
 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.~
 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.~
 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?~
 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.~
 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.~
 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.~
 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?~
 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?~
 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?~
 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?~
 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?~
 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,~
 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.~
 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;~
 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.~
 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.~
 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?~
 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.~
 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.~
 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.~
 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.~
 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.~
 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.~
 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?~
 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?~
 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.~
 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.~
 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.~
 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,~
 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.~
 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,~
 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.~
 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.~
 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,~
 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.~
 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?~
 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?~
 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.~
 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.~
 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.~
 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.~
 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.~
 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.~
 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.~
 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.~
 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.~
 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.~
 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.~
 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.~
 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.~
 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.~
 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.~
 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?~
 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?~
 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?~
 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?~
 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?~
 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?~
 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?~
 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.~
 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?~
 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?~
 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.~
 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.~
 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?~
 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.~
 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.~
 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.~
 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.~
 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.~
 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.~
 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.~
 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.~
 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.~
 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.~
 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.~
 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.~
 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.~
 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.~
 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.~
 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.~
 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.~
 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.~
 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.~
 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.~
 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.~
 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,~
 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.~
 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.~
 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.~
 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.~
 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.~
 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.~
 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.~
 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.~
 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.~
 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.~
 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.~
 He had also seven sons and three daughters.~
 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.~
 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.~
 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.~
 So Job died, being old and full of days.~
 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.~
 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.~
 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.~
 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.~
 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.~
 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.~
 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?~
 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,~
 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.~
 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall have them in derision.~
 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.~
 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.~
 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.~
 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.~
 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.~
 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.~
 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.~
 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.~
 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.~
 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.~
 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.~
 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.~
 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.~
 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.~
 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.~
 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.~
 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.~
 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.~
 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.~
 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.~
 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.~
 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.~
 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.~
 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.~
 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.~
 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.~
 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.~
 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.~
 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.~
 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.~
 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.~
 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.~
 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.~
 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.~
 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.~
 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.~
 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.~
 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.~
 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?~
 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.~
 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?~
 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.~
 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.~
 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.~
 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.~
 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.~
 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:~
 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.~
 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;~
 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)~
