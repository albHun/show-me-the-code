 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;~
 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.~
 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.~
 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.~
 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;~
 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.~
 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.~
 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.~
 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.~
 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.~
 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.~
 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.~
 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:~
 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,~
 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.~
 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.~
 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.~
 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.~
 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:~
 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.~
 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.~
 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.~
 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.~
 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.~
 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.~
 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;~
 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.~
 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.~
 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.~
 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.~
 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.~
 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.~
 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.~
 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.~
 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?~
 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?~
 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.~
 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.~
 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.~
 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?~
 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?~
 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?~
 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.~
 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;~
 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.~
 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.~
 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.~
 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?~
 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.~
 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.~
 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.~
 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?~
 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.~
 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.~
 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.~
 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.~
 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.~
 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.~
 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.~
 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.~
 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.~
 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,~
 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:~
 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.~
 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:~
 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.~
 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.~
 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.~
 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.~
 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.~
 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.~
 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.~
 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.~
 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.~
 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.~
 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.~
 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.~
 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice~
 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.~
 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.~
 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.~
 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.~
 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.~
 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.~
 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.~
 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.~
 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.~
 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.~
 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.~
 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.~
 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.~
 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.~
 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.~
 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.~
 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.~
 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.~
 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.~
 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.~
 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together~
 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.~
 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.~
 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.~
 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.~
 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.~
 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.~
 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.~
 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.~
 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.~
 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.~
 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.~
 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.~
 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.~
 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.~
 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.~
 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.~
 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.~
 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.~
 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.~
 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.~
 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.~
 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.~
 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.~
 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.~
 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.~
 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.~
 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.~
 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.~
 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.~
 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.~
 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.~
 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.~
 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.~
 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.~
 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.~
 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.~
 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.~
 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.~
 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.~
 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.~
 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.~
 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;~
 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;~
 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;~
 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.~
 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.~
 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.~
 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.~
 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:~
 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.~
 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.~
 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.~
 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:~
 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;~
 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;~
 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.~
 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.~
 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.~
 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.~
 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.~
 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.~
 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.~
 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.~
 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.~
 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.~
 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.~
 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.~
 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;~
 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.~
 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.~
 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.~
 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.~
 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.~
 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.~
 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:~
 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:~
 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:~
 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.~
 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.~
 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.~
 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.~
 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.~
 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.~
 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.~
 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.~
 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.~
 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;~
 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.~
 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;~
 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.~
 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.~
 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.~
 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.~
 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.~
 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.~
 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.~
 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.~
 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.~
 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.~
 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.~
 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.~
