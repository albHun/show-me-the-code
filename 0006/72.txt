 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?~
 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.~
 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.~
 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.~
 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.~
 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.~
 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.~
 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.~
 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.~
 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.~
 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.~
 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.~
 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.~
 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.~
 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.~
 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.~
 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.~
 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.~
 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.~
 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.~
 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?~
 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.~
 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.~
 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.~
 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.~
 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:~
 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.~
 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.~
 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.~
 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.~
 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.~
 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.~
 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.~
 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.~
 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.~
 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.~
 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.~
 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.~
 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.~
 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.~
 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.~
 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.~
 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.~
 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.~
 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.~
 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.~
 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.~
 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.~
 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.~
 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.~
 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.~
 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.~
 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.~
 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.~
 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.~
 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.~
 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.~
 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.~
 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.~
 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.~
 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.~
 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.~
 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.~
 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.~
 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.~
 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.~
 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.~
 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.~
 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.~
 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.~
 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.~
 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.~
 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.~
 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.~
 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.~
 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.~
 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.~
 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.~
 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.~
 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.~
 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.~
 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.~
 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.~
 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.~
 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.~
 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.~
 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.~
 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.~
 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.~
 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.~
 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.~
 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.~
 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.~
 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.~
 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.~
 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.~
 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.~
 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.~
 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.~
 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.~
 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.~
 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.~
 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.~
 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.~
 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.~
 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.~
 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.~
 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.~
 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.~
 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.~
 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.~
 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.~
 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.~
 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.~
 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.~
 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,~
 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.~
 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.~
 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.~
 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.~
 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.~
 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.~
 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.~
 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.~
 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.~
 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.~
 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.~
 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.~
 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.~
 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.~
 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.~
 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.~
 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,~
 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.~
 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.~
 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.~
 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.~
 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.~
 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.~
 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.~
 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.~
 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.~
 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.~
 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.~
 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.~
 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.~
 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.~
 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?~
 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.~
 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.~
 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.~
 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.~
 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.~
 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.~
 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.~
 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.~
 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.~
 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?~
 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?~
 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.~
 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me?  hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.~
 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.~
 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.~
 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.~
 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?~
 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?~
 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.~
 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.~
 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?~
 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.~
 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.~
 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.~
 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.~
 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.~
 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.~
 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.~
 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.~
 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.~
 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.~
 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.~
 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.~
 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.~
 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.~
 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.~
 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.~
 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.~
 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,~
 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.~
 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.~
 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;~
 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.~
 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;~
 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.~
 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.~
 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.~
 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?~
 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.~
 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.~
 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.~
 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.~
