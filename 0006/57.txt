 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.~
 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?~
 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.~
 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.~
 And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?~
 And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.~
 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.~
 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.~
 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,~
 And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.~
 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.~
 And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?  and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.~
 But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.~
 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.~
 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.~
 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.~
 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,~
 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,~
 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.~
 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah.~
 He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,~
 And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,~
 And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,~
 And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,~
 And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities.~
 And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine.~
 And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.~
 And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts.~
 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD:~
 And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.~
 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.~
 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.~
 And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;~
 Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.~
 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.~
 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)~
 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.~
 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.~
 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.~
 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,~
 With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.~
 And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.~
 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.~
 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.~
 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.~
 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.~
 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.~
 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.~
 And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.~
 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.~
 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.~
 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.~
 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.~
 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.~
 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah.~
 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.~
 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.~
 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;~
 Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?~
 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.~
 And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.~
 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.~
 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.~
 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:~
 And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.~
 And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.~
 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.~
 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.~
 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.~
 And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.~
 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.~
 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers.~
 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.~
 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.~
 But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.~
 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.~
 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.~
 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:~
 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:~
 And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.~
 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.~
 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.~
 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.~
 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.~
 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.~
 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.~
 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.~
 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.~
 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.~
 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.~
 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.~
 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:~
 And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.~
 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.~
 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.~
 And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.~
 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.~
 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.~
 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.~
 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.~
 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.~
 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.~
 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;~
 That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.~
 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.~
 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.~
 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.~
 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.~
 And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.~
 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.~
 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.~
 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,~
 There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.~
 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.~
 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease.~
 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.~
 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.~
 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.~
 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.~
 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.~
 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.~
 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.~
 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.~
 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.~
 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.~
 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.~
 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;~
 But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.~
 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance.~
 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.~
 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.~
 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.~
 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.~
 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.~
 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.~
 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store.~
 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.~
 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.~
 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand.~
 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour.~
 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.~
 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.~
 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.~
 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab.~
 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.~
 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.~
 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day.~
 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.~
 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him?~
 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.~
 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.~
 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.~
 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed.~
 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.~
 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of their's, and speak thou good.~
 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak.~
 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.~
 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD?~
 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.~
 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?~
 Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.~
 And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.~
 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith?~
 And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.~
 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee.~
 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?~
 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.~
 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;~
 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.~
 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.~
 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.~
 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.~
 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel.~
 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.~
 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him.~
 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.~
 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.~
 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.~
 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD.~
 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God.~
 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.~
 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,~
 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.~
 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.~
 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.~
 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.~
 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass.~
 And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good.~
 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.~
 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi.~
 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.~
 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD.~
 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,~
 And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?~
 Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?~
 And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying,~
 If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.~
 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;~
 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.~
 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.~
