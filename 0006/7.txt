 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.~
 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.~
 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.~
 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.~
 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.~
 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.~
 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.~
 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.~
 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.~
 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.~
 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.~
 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.~
 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;~
 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.~
 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.~
 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.~
 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive.~
 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;~
 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.~
 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?~
 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.~
 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.~
 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.~
 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers.~
 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.~
 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:~
 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.~
 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.~
 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?~
 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.~
 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.~
 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.~
 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.~
 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.~
 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.~
 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.~
 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.~
 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year.~
 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:~
 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.~
 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.~
 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.~
 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.~
 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.~
 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.~
 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.~
 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.~
 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.~
 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.~
 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:~
 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.~
 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.~
 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.~
 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.~
 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,~
 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.~
 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.~
 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.~
 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.~
 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?~
 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.~
 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.~
 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.~
 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.~
 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.~
 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.~
 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,~
 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.~
 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.~
 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.~
 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.~
 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.~
 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.~
 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.~
 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.~
 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.~
 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:~
 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.~
 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.~
 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.~
 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.~
 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.~
 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?~
 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.~
 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:~
 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.~
 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.~
 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:~
 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.~
 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.~
 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.~
 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.~
 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.~
 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.~
 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.~
 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:~
 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:~
 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)~
 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:~
 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.~
 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.~
 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.~
 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,~
 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.~
 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.~
 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.~
 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.~
 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.~
 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.~
 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.~
 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,~
 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.~
 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.~
 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,~
 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.~
 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.~
 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.~
 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.~
 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:~
 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.~
 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.~
 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.~
 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,~
 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.~
 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.~
 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?~
 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.~
 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.~
 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.~
 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.~
 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.~
 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.~
 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.~
 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.~
 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,~
 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,~
 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.~
 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.~
 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.~
 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.~
 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.~
 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:~
 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.~
 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.~
 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.~
 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:~
 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.~
 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:~
 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.~
 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.~
 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?~
 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.~
 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.~
 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.~
 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.~
 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.~
 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.~
 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.~
 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.~
 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.~
 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.~
 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?~
 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.~
 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.~
 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.~
 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.~
 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.~
 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?~
 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.~
 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.~
 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.~
 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.~
 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?~
 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.~
 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.~
 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.~
 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.~
 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.~
 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.~
 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.~
 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.~
 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.~
 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.~
 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.~
 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.~
 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.~
 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;~
 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.~
 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.~
 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.~
 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?~
 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.~
 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?~
 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.~
 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.~
 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:~
 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.~
 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.~
 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.~
 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.~
