 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.~
 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.~
 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.~
 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.~
 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,~
 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?~
 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?~
 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.~
 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.~
 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.~
 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?~
 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?~
 What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?~
 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.~
 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?~
 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,~
 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?~
 What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?~
 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.~
 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?~
 I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;~
 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:~
 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.~
 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.~
 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.~
 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.~
 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.~
 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.~
 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.~
 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:~
 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.~
 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.~
 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.~
 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.~
 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.~
 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.~
 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.~
 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.~
 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.~
 Then Job answered and said,~
 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.~
 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?~
 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.~
 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.~
 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?~
 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.~
 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.~
 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.~
 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.~
 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.~
 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.~
 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.~
 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.~
 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.~
 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;~
 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.~
 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.~
 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.~
 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.~
 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!~
 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.~
 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.~
 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?~
 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?~
 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.~
 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.~
 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.~
 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.~
 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.~
 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.~
 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.~
 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.~
 They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.~
 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.~
 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.~
 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?~
 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.~
 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,~
 How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.~
 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?~
 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?~
 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.~
 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.~
 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.~
 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.~
 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.~
 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.~
 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.~
 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.~
 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.~
 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.~
 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.~
 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.~
 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.~
 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.~
 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.~
 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.~
 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.~
 Then Job answered and said,~
 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?~
 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.~
 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.~
 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:~
 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.~
 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.~
 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.~
 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.~
 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.~
 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.~
 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.~
 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.~
 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.~
 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.~
 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.~
 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.~
 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.~
 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.~
 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.~
 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.~
 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?~
 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!~
 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!~
 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:~
 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:~
 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.~
 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?~
 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.~
 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,~
 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.~
 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.~
 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,~
 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?~
 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;~
 Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?~
 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.~
 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.~
 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.~
 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.~
 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;~
 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:~
 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.~
 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.~
 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.~
 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.~
 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.~
 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;~
 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.~
 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.~
 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.~
 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.~
 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.~
 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.~
 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.~
 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.~
 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.~
 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.~
 But Job answered and said,~
 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.~
 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.~
 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?~
 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.~
 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.~
 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?~
 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.~
 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.~
 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.~
 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.~
 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.~
 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.~
 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.~
 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?~
 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.~
 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.~
 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.~
 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.~
 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.~
 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?~
 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.~
 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.~
 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.~
 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.~
 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.~
 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.~
 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?~
 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,~
 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.~
 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?~
 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.~
 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.~
 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?~
 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,~
 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?~
 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?~
 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?~
 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?~
 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.~
 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.~
 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.~
 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.~
 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;~
