 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.~
 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:~
 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:~
 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.~
 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,~
 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:~
 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.~
 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony,~
 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense,~
 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.~
 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.~
 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.~
 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.~
 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.~
 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.~
 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:~
 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:~
 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.~
 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.~
 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:~
 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,~
 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,~
 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.~
 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;~
 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,~
 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,~
 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,~
 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,~
 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,~
 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.~
 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.~
 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.~
 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.~
 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.~
 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.~
 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.~
 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.~
 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.~
 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.~
 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.~
 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.~
 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:~
 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.~
 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:~
 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.~
 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?~
 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.~
 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.~
 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.~
 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.~
 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.~
 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.~
 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.~
 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.~
 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.~
 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?~
 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.~
 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.~
 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.~
 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)~
 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.~
 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.~
 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.~
 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.~
 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.~
 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.~
 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.~
 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.~
 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.~
 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.~
 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:~
 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:~
 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.~
 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.~
 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.~
 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.~
 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.~
 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.~
 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.~
 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.~
 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.~
 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.~
 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.~
 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.~
 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.~
 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.~
 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.~
 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.~
 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.~
 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.~
 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:~
 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:~
 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.~
 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.~
 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.~
 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.~
 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.~
 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD.~
 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,~
 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.~
 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.~
 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.~
 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.~
 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.~
 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:~
 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves:~
 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:~
 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;~
 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.~
 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.~
 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.~
 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.~
 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.~
 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.~
 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.~
 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel.~
 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.~
 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.~
 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.~
 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.~
 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.~
 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.~
 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.~
 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.~
 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.~
 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.~
 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.~
 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.~
 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.~
 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.~
 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.~
 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,~
 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass,~
 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,~
 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,~
 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,~
 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.~
 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded;~
 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,~
 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering,~
 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread,~
 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,~
 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle,~
 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,~
 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,~
 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,~
 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.~
 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.~
 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.~
 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.~
 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.~
 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.~
 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.~
 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair.~
 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;~
 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.~
 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.~
 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah;~
 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;~
 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,~
 And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.~
 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.~
 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.~
 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded.~
 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:~
 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.~
 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;~
 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make.~
 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.~
 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.~
 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.~
 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.~
 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.~
 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.~
 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.~
 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.~
 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.~
 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.~
 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.~
 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.~
 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.~
 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.~
 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.~
 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.~
 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.~
 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward:~
 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.~
 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards,~
 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.~
 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.~
 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.~
 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.~
 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.~
 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,~
 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.~
 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.~
