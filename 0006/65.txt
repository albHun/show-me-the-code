 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?~
 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?~
 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.~
 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?~
 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?~
 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.~
 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.~
 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.~
 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?~
 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?~
 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:~
 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.~
 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.~
 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.~
 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.~
 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.~
 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.~
 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.~
 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.~
 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.~
 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?~
 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;~
 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:~
 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.~
 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.~
 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?~
 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?~
 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?~
 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?  why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?~
 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.~
 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,~
 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?~
 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?~
 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;~
 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;~
 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.~
 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.~
 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:~
 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)~
 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?~
 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?~
 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.~
 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:~
 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.~
 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.~
 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.~
 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.~
 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.~
 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.~
 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:~
 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.~
 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.~
 Then Job answered and said,~
 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?~
 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.~
 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?~
 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.~
 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.~
 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.~
 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.~
 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.~
 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.~
 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.~
 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?~
 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.~
 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?~
 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.~
 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.~
 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.~
 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.~
 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?~
 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.~
 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.~
 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.~
 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.~
 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?~
 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.~
 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.~
 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:~
 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.~
 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?~
 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;~
 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.~
 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.~
 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.~
 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:~
 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.~
 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.~
 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.~
 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?~
 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?~
 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,~
 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?~
 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.~
 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.~
 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?~
 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?~
 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.~
 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.~
 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.~
 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.~
 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;~
 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.~
 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.~
 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!~
 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.~
 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,~
 Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;~
 A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.~
 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,~
 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?~
 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?~
 For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.~
 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;~
 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.~
 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?~
 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?~
 The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.~
 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?~
 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?~
 For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.~
 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;~
 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.~
 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:~
 Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:~
 And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.~
 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.~
 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.~
 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.~
 And Job answered and said,~
 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.~
 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?~
 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.~
 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.~
 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.~
 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:~
 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.~
 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?~
 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.~
 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?~
 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.~
 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.~
 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.~
 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.~
 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.~
 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.~
 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.~
 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.~
 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.~
 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.~
 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.~
 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.~
 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.~
 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.~
 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.~
 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.~
 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.~
 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.~
 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.~
 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.~
 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?~
 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?~
 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?~
 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.~
 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?~
 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.~
 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.~
 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?~
 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.~
 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.~
 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.~
 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.~
 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.~
 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.~
 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.~
 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.~
 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.~
 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?~
 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?~
 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.~
 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.~
 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.~
 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.~
 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.~
 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?~
 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.~
 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;~
 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.~
 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.~
 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;~
 Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.~
 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?~
 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:~
 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.~
 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!~
 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.~
 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.~
 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?~
 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.~
 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.~
