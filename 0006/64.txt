 And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour,~
 Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head:~
 And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour.~
 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.~
 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.~
 And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered.~
 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.~
 And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared.~
 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.~
 And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.~
 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:~
 For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.~
 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?~
 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.~
 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.~
 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.~
 And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.~
 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.~
 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.~
 And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.~
 And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.~
 Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and stood before the king,~
 And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's provinces:~
 For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?~
 Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.~
 Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.~
 Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.~
 And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:~
 Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,~
 Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.~
 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.~
 So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was given at Shushan the palace.~
 And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.~
 The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.~
 And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.~
 Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)~
 The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.~
 And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.~
 For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.~
 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them.~
 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.~
 And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,~
 And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,~
 And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,~
 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.~
 On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king.~
 And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be done.~
 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.~
 And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.~
 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.~
 But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,~
 On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.~
 But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.~
 Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.~
 And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far,~
 To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,~
 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.~
 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written unto them;~
 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;~
 But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.~
 Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,~
 The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed time every year;~
 And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.~
 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.~
 And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,~
 To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.~
 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.~
 And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea.~
 And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?~
 For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.~
 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.~
 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.~
 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.~
 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.~
 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.~
 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.~
 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.~
 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?~
 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?~
 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.~
 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.~
 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.~
 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:~
 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:~
 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.~
 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.~
 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.~
 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:~
 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.~
 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,~
 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.~
 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.~
 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.~
 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.~
 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.~
 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.~
 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.~
 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.~
 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.~
 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.~
 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?  curse God, and die.~
 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.~
 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.~
 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.~
 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.~
 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.~
 And Job spake, and said,~
 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.~
 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.~
 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.~
 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.~
 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.~
 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.~
 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:~
 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.~
 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?~
 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?~
 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,~
 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;~
 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:~
 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.~
 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.~
 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.~
 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.~
 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;~
 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;~
 Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?~
 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?~
 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.~
 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.~
 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.~
 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,~
 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?~
 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.~
 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.~
 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.~
 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?~
 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?~
 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.~
 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.~
 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.~
 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.~
 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.~
 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,~
 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.~
 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:~
 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,~
 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?~
 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:~
 How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?~
 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.~
 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.~
 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?~
 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.~
 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.~
 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.~
 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.~
 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;~
 Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.~
 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:~
 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:~
 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:~
 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.~
 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.~
 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.~
 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.~
 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.~
 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.~
 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:~
 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.~
 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.~
 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.~
 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.~
 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.~
 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.~
 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.~
 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.~
 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.~
 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.~
 But Job answered and said,~
 Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!~
 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.~
 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.~
 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?~
 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?~
 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.~
 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!~
 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!~
 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.~
 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?~
 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?~
 Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?~
 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.~
 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;~
 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:~
 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.~
 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.~
 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.~
 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.~
 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.~
